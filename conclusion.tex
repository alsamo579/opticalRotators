\section*{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated a new system for optical micro-rotation of birefringent vaterite particles without the use of an optical tweezing configuration. The optical and physical properties of the constituent particles have also been characterized. In particular, we have experimentally measured the transmittance of microvaterite by analyzing the behavior of particles in the presence of IR light. In quantifying the minimum light ellipticity required for rotation, we obtain a measure of the difference between the ordinary and extraordinary axis of our microparticles. We find that this quantity deviates from the expected value of a single crystal, and differs from past studies where a different procedure was used for synthesis of microparticles. This same measurement allows us to also effectively model the dependence of particles' rotation on incident flux and size. Finally, we note that rotating particles maintain their translational diffusive motion in the presence of the incident beam, indicating that no radial trapping forces are present within our system.
